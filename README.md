## Dev Packages

packages for my own node project.

**Notice: npm must be updated to 3**

### Structure

[Monorepo](https://github.com/babel/babel/blob/master/doc/design/monorepo.md)~~

Since `npm@3` flatten all dependences and move all `bin`s into root `.bin` of node_packages,
we could add cli dependences in the grouped package to scope them and install dependences by group
